    Do not try to use pthread_cond_timedwait_relative_np on newer Android

    API was deprecated, do not use (still available on Apple).
    Rename USE_CLOCK_IN_COND to USE_CLOCK_GETTIME_IN_COND to make
    more clear.
    Put check for pthread_cond_timedwait_relative_np in a single
    place defining a new USE_COND_TIMEDWAIT_RELATIVE if we can use
    it.
    Declare tv variable near gettimeofday to reduce conditional
    compilation.

    Get Windows code page using Windows API

    Instead of using setlocale call use GetLocaleInfoA.
    This fixes getting Windows code page.
    setlocale should return the code page number as first item
    but it depends on too many settings and sometimes the string
    does not start with the code page number.
    Updated ODBC test to avoid not convertible character; note that
    now the behaviour is more coherent to Windows driver for this test.

    tds: Fix possible issue with 32 bit machines using BCP

    The -2 constant should be signed extended to 64 bit and passed
    to tds_put_int8. This potentially does not happen on 32 bit
    as the ?: operator would return a size_t (unsigned 32 bit on
    32 bit systems).
    Force the type to get the correct value.
